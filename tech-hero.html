        <h2>Richa Kaul — CEO of Complyance</h2>

        <p>
          Richa Kaul is the CEO and founder of <strong>Complyance</strong>, a company focused on
          using artificial intelligence to improve transparency and accountability in corporate
          compliance and governance. Through her leadership, she works at the intersection of
          technology, regulation, and ethical responsibility.
        </p>

        <p>
          Complyance leverages data and AI tools to help organizations understand risk,
          ensure compliance, and operate more responsibly. In a world where data-driven
          systems increasingly influence business decisions, Kaul’s work demonstrates how
          technology can be used not just for efficiency, but for integrity.
        </p>

        <h2>Why She Is Our Tech Hero</h2>

        <p>
          As women pursuing careers in technology and data, we are inspired by Richa Kaul’s
          leadership in a space that has historically been male-dominated. Seeing a woman lead
          an AI-driven company reinforces that innovation and authority in tech are not limited
          by gender.
        </p>

        <p>
          What stands out to us most is how she integrates ethics into technological development.
          In LIS 500, we examine how power shapes digital systems. Kaul’s work reflects that same
          awareness — recognizing that data and algorithms influence real people and real outcomes.
        </p>

        <p>
          We admire her commitment to accountability, transparency, and using technology as a
          force for responsible decision-making. Her career represents the kind of impact we hope
          to make as future professionals in tech and data analytics.
        </p>
