        <h2>Richa Kaul — CEO of Complyance</h2>

       <p>
  For our tech hero, we focused on Richa Kaul, who is the CEO and founder of <strong>Complyance</strong>.
  Complyance is a company that focuses on using AI to improve accountability in corporate
  compliance and governance settings. She works at the intersection of technology and
  ethical responsibility in the workplace.
</p>

<p>
  Complyance helps companies understand risk and ensure greater responsibility in business
  decision-making. They do this by utilizing data and AI tools, working toward a world where
  data-driven systems positively influence business decisions. Through her leadership,
  Richa Kaul demonstrates how technology can be used for accountability and transparency —
  not just efficiency.
</p>

<p>
  As two women hoping to pursue careers in the field of technology, we look up to Richa Kaul
  as someone who has excelled in a traditionally male-dominated industry. She shows us that
  gender does not limit our abilities in technology and inspires us to pursue leadership roles
  with confidence.
</p>

<p>
  In LIS 500, we examine how technology and society are integrated and how systems shape
  power and decision-making. Richa Kaul’s work reflects this same idea by showing how
  technology and algorithms influence real-world outcomes and impact people’s lives.
  Her commitment to responsible innovation highlights the importance of using technology
  ethically and demonstrates the impact we can make as future women in technology.
