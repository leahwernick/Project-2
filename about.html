        <h2>About Leah</h2>

        <p>
          Hi! I’m Leah, a sophomore at UW–Madison majoring in <strong>Information Systems</strong>.
          I’m especially interested in how data can be used to understand people’s behavior, improve decision-making,
          and create better digital experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          Right now, I’m exploring career paths in <strong>data analytics</strong> and other roles that combine
          technology, business, and strategy. I enjoy projects where we take messy information, find patterns,
          and turn it into something clear and useful.
        </p>

        <h2>About Kiera</h2>

       <p>
  Hi! I’m Kiera, a junior at UW–Madison majoring in <strong>Information Science</strong>.
  I’ve always been interested in technology and how it interacts with our world.
</p>

<p>
  I hope to one day make technology more <strong>accessible and impactful</strong> in everyday life.
  Through this course, I’m excited to explore the relationship between <strong>technology and society</strong>,
  especially understanding digital divides and how they shape communities and future innovation.

    <!-- Why We Took LIS 500 Section -->
    <h2>Why We Took LIS 500</h2>

    <p>
      We took <strong>LIS 500: Code and Power</strong> because we want to better understand how technology connects to
      real-world consequences. As digital tools become more integrated into everyday life, it’s important to consider
      how power, bias, and inequality can be reflected in data, algorithms, and platform design.
    </p>

    <p>
      This course helps us think more critically about who benefits from technology, who may be excluded, and what
      responsibility designers and developers have in building more equitable systems.
    </p>
