    <h2>The Intersection of Code and Society</h2>

    <p>
      Welcome to our<strong>LIS 500: Code and Power</strong> website. 
      Here, you will be able to read about us and our journey in understanding technology, society and how they intertwine.
    </p>

    <p>
    Throughout LIS 500, we plan to learn how technology shapes our power systems and society,
     where we see who holds the most, the least and inequalities within it. Identifying who benefits 
     from technology, who is at a disadvantage and how the use of technology impacts communities that utilize it. 
    </p>

    <p>
     This website demonstates our interpretations of technology and how it blends with responsibility, 
     equity, accountability in ethical, social and political contexts. We hope to learn how to think analytically
     about the use of technology, learning how it can be used for accountability and overall more accessible for all. 
    </p>
