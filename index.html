    <h2>The Intersection of Code and Society</h2>

    <p>
      Welcome to our digital portfolio for <strong>LIS 500: Code and Power</strong>.
      In this space, we document our journey as students examining the ethical,
      social, and political implications of the technology we build and use.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout this course, we explore how digital systems are shaped by
      power structures — and how those systems can reinforce or challenge inequality.
      From algorithmic bias to platform design, we consider who benefits from
      technology, who is left out, and how design decisions impact different communities.
    </p>

    <p>
      This portfolio represents our collaborative work as we engage with questions
      of equity, responsibility, and accountability in computing. Our goal is to think
      critically about how technology can be designed more thoughtfully and more justly.
