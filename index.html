    <h2>The Intersection of Code and Society</h2>

    <p>
      Welcome to our digital portfolio for <strong>LIS 500: Code and Power</strong>. In this space, we document our journey
      as students examining the ethical, social, and political implications of the technology we build and interact with.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout this course, we explore how digital systems are shaped by power structures — and how those same systems
      can reinforce or challenge inequality. From algorithmic bias to platform design, we examine how technology affects
      people differently depending on identity, access, and representation.
    </p>

    <p>
      This portfolio represents our collaborative work and reflections as we engage with questions of equity,
      responsibility, and accountability in computing. We aim to think critically about how technology can be designed
      more thoughtfully and more justly.
    </p>
